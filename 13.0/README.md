# Document Databases

The main types of NoSQL databases are document, key-value, wide-column, and graph.

NoSQL is a database used to manage sets of unstructured data, where in the data is not stored in tabular relations like relational databases.

Document databases store data in documents in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects.

Each document can be different and depends on the varying number of fields.

In order to retrieve all of the information about an entity and their properties, a single document can be retrieved from the database.

A common misconception is that non-relational databases donâ€™t store relationship data well, but NoSQL databases can store relationship data well.

MongoDB does know the types of the fields of the stored entities, but it has no information about which collection of entities the user record ids are referring to.
