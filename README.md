# Relational Databases

A relational database represents a collection of related tables. 

You can communicate with relational databases using Structured Query Language (SQL).

PostgreSQL is based on the object-relational model.

**Relations**

The Cartesian product of two sets, X and Y, denoted by X × Y , is the set of all ordered pairs (x,y), where X is an element of X and y is an element of Y.

X × Y = { (x,y) | x ∈ X ∧ y ∈ Y }

Relations are represented as tables consisting of rows and columns and that these relations could be accessed using a high-level nonprocedural (or declarative) language.

A relational schema is a set of relational table definitions, constraints, and derivation rules.

**Non-Relational Databases**

Non-Relational databases provide ways of storing, searching and retrieving data other than in tables with relationships.

MongoDB is a document database that stores records as loosely structured documents.
